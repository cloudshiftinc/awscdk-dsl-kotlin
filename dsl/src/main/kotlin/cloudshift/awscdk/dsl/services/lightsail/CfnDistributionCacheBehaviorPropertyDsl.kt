   * headers, or query strings to personalize content.

   * content. When specified, your distribution caches and serves only the content that is specified in
   * the distributionâ€™s `CacheBehaviorPerPath` parameter. This behavior is ideal for websites or web
   * applications that use cookies, headers, and query strings to personalize content for individual
   * users.
