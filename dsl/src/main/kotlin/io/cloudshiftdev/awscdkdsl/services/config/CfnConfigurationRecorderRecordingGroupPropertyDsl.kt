/**
 * Specifies which resource types AWS Config records for configuration changes.
 *
 * In the recording group, you specify whether you want to record all supported resource types or to
 * include or exclude specific types of resources.
 *
 * By default, AWS Config records configuration changes for all supported types of *Regional
 * resources* that AWS Config discovers in the AWS Region in which it is running. Regional resources
 * are tied to a Region and can be used only in that Region. Examples of Regional resources are
 * Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes.
 *
 * You can also have AWS Config record supported types of *globally recorded resources* . Globally
 * recorded resource types are not tied to a specific Region and can be used in all Regions. The
 * globally recorded resource types that AWS Config supports are IAM users, groups, roles, and
 * customer managed policies. These resource types are recorded in all enabled AWS Config regions
 * where AWS Config was available before February 2022 (which excludes Asia Pacific (Hyderabad),
 * Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich), Israel (Tel Aviv), and Middle East
 * (UAE)). AWS Config also supports some global resources types for Amazon Elastic Container
 * Registry Public, AWS Global Accelerator , and Amazon RouteÂ 53; however, these resource types are
 * not globally recorded in all enabled AWS Config regions.
 *
 * Global resource types onboarded to AWS Config recording after February 2022 will be recorded only
 * in the service's home Region for the commercial partition and AWS GovCloud (US-West) for the AWS
 * GovCloud (US) partition. You can view the Configuration Items for these new global resource types
 * only in their home Region and AWS GovCloud (US-West).
 *
 * If you don't want AWS Config to record all resources, you can specify which types of resources
 * AWS Config records with the `resourceTypes` parameter.
 *
 * For a list of supported resource types, see
 * [Supported Resource Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources)
 * in the *AWS Config developer guide* .
 *
 * For more information and a table of the Home Regions for Global Resource Types Onboarded after
 * February 2022, see
 * [Selecting Which Resources AWS Config Records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html)
 * in the *AWS Config developer guide* .
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import software.amazon.awscdk.services.config.*;
 * RecordingGroupProperty recordingGroupProperty = RecordingGroupProperty.builder()
 * .allSupported(false)
 * .includeGlobalResourceTypes(false)
 * .resourceTypes(List.of("resourceTypes"))
 * .build();
 * ```
