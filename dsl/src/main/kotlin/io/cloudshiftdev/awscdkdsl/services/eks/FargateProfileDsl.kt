/**
 * Fargate profiles allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate.
 *
 * This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have up to five
 * selectors that contain a namespace and optional labels. You must define a namespace for every
 * selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match a
 * selector (by matching a namespace for the selector and all of the labels specified in the
 * selector) are scheduled on Fargate. If a namespace selector is defined without any labels, Amazon
 * EKS will attempt to schedule all pods that run in that namespace onto Fargate using the profile.
 * If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is
 * scheduled on Fargate.
 *
 * If a pod matches multiple Fargate profiles, Amazon EKS picks one of the matches at random. In
 * this case, you can specify which profile a pod should use by adding the following Kubernetes
 * label to the pod specification: eks.amazonaws.com/fargate-profile: profile_name. However, the pod
 * must still match a selector in that profile in order to be scheduled onto Fargate.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * Cluster cluster;
 * FargateProfile.Builder.create(this, "MyProfile")
 * .cluster(cluster)
 * .selectors(List.of(Selector.builder().namespace("default").build()))
 * .build();
 * ```
