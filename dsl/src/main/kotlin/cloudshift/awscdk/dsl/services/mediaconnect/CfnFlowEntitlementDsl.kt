/**
 * The AWS::MediaConnect::FlowEntitlement resource defines the permission that an AWS account grants
 * to another AWS account to allow access to the content in a specific AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow.
 *
 * The content originator grants an entitlement to a specific AWS account (the subscriber). When an
 * entitlement is granted, the subscriber can create a flow using the originator's flow as the source.
 * Each flow can have up to 50 entitlements.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import software.amazon.awscdk.services.mediaconnect.*;
 * CfnFlowEntitlement cfnFlowEntitlement = CfnFlowEntitlement.Builder.create(this,
 * "MyCfnFlowEntitlement")
 * .description("description")
 * .flowArn("flowArn")
 * .name("name")
 * .subscribers(List.of("subscribers"))
 * // the properties below are optional
 * .dataTransferSubscriberFeePercent(123)
