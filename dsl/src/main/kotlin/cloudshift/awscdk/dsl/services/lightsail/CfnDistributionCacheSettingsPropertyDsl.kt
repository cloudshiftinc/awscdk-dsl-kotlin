/**
 * `CacheSettings` is a property of the
 * [AWS::Lightsail::Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lightsail-distribution.html)
 * resource. It describes the cache settings of an Amazon Lightsail content delivery network (CDN)
 * distribution.
 *
 * These settings apply only to your distributionâ€™s `CacheBehaviors` that have a `Behavior` of
 * `cache` . This includes the `DefaultCacheBehavior` .
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * // The code below shows an example of how to instantiate this type.
 * // The values are placeholders you should change.
 * import software.amazon.awscdk.services.lightsail.*;
 * CacheSettingsProperty cacheSettingsProperty = CacheSettingsProperty.builder()
 * .allowedHttpMethods("allowedHttpMethods")
 * .cachedHttpMethods("cachedHttpMethods")
 * .defaultTtl(123)
 * .forwardedCookies(CookieObjectProperty.builder()
 * .cookiesAllowList(List.of("cookiesAllowList"))
 * .option("option")
 * .build())
 * .forwardedHeaders(HeaderObjectProperty.builder()
 * .headersAllowList(List.of("headersAllowList"))
 * .option("option")
 * .build())
 * .forwardedQueryStrings(QueryStringObjectProperty.builder()
 * .option(false)
 * .queryStringsAllowList(List.of("queryStringsAllowList"))
 * .build())
 * .maximumTtl(123)
 * .minimumTtl(123)
 * .build();
