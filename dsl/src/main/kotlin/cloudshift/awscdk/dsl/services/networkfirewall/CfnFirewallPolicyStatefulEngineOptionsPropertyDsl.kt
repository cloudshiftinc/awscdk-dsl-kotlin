  /**
   * @param streamExceptionPolicy Configures how Network Firewall processes traffic when a network
   * connection breaks midstream.
   * Network connections can break due to disruptions in external networks or within the firewall
   * itself.
   *
   * * `DROP` - Network Firewall fails closed and drops all subsequent traffic going to the
   * firewall. This is the default behavior.
   * * `CONTINUE` - Network Firewall continues to apply rules to the subsequent traffic without
   * context from traffic before the break. This impacts the behavior of rules that depend on this
   * context. For example, if you have a stateful rule to `drop http` traffic, Network Firewall won't
   * match the traffic for this rule because the service won't have the context from session
   * initialization defining the application layer protocol as HTTP. However, this behavior is rule
   * dependentâ€”a TCP-layer rule using a `flow:stateless` rule would still match, as would the
   * `aws:drop_strict` default action.
   * * `REJECT` - Network Firewall fails closed and drops all subsequent traffic going to the
   * firewall. Network Firewall also sends a TCP reject packet back to your client so that the client
   * can immediately establish a new session. Network Firewall will have context about the new session
   * and will apply rules to the subsequent traffic.
