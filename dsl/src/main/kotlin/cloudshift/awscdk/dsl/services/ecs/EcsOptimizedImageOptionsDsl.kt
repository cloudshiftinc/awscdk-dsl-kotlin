   * @param cachedInContext Whether the AMI ID is cached to be stable between deployments.
   * By default, the newest image is used on each deployment. This will cause
   * instances to be replaced whenever a new version is released, and may cause
   * downtime if there aren't enough running instances in the AutoScalingGroup
   * to reschedule the tasks on.
   *
   * If set to true, the AMI ID will be cached in `cdk.context.json` and the
   * same value will be used on future runs. Your instances will not be replaced
   * but your AMI version will grow old over time. To refresh the AMI lookup,
   * you will have to evict the value from the cache using the `cdk context`
   * command. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/context.html for
   * more information.
   *
   * Can not be set to `true` in environment-agnostic stacks.
